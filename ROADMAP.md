# FoundryVTT Movement Categories Module - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
A system-agnostic FoundryVTT module that displays movement categories between tokens based on relative distances, abstracting movement into categorical chunks (Near, Close, Far, Distant, Remote).

## Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Create module.json manifest file
- [ ] Set up basic module structure and files
- [ ] Initialize version control and development environment
- [ ] Create basic HTML/CSS for module styling

### 1.2 Core Distance System
- [ ] Implement Euclidean distance calculation utilities
- [ ] Define and implement the 5 distance categories (Near: 1m, Close: 10m, Far: 25m, Distant: 100m, Remote: 100m+)
- [ ] Create token relationship mapping system
- [ ] Add basic error handling for invalid tokens

### 1.3 Basic Visual Display (Rings Mode)
- [ ] Implement colored ring rendering around tokens
- [ ] Apply green-to-red color gradient system
- [ ] Add basic transparency support
- [ ] Create simple toggle on/off functionality

### 1.4 Essential FoundryVTT Integration
- [ ] Set up core Foundry hooks (updateToken, controlToken)
- [ ] Implement basic token selection handling
- [ ] Add module activation/deactivation logic
- [ ] Test with basic token movement

**Deliverable**: Basic working module that shows colored rings around a selected token indicating distance categories to other tokens.

## Phase 2: Core Features & UI (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 Enhanced Visual System
- [ ] Implement line tracing display mode
- [ ] Add text labels for categories ("Near", "Close", etc.)
- [ ] Create user-selectable display mode switching
- [ ] Improve visual performance and rendering

### 2.2 User Interface Controls
- [ ] Add UI toggle button to FoundryVTT interface
- [ ] Create macro commands for activation/deactivation
- [ ] Implement reference point mode switching
- [ ] Add visual feedback for module state

### 2.3 Settings System
- [ ] Implement FoundryVTT settings API integration
- [ ] Add user preference settings (transparency, display mode)
- [ ] Create GM world settings (distance thresholds, performance limits)
- [ ] Add settings validation and error handling

### 2.4 Token Scope & Filtering
- [ ] Implement actor token filtering (exclude objects)
- [ ] Add token visibility validation
- [ ] Handle multiple token selection (use first as reference)
- [ ] Create efficient token tracking system

**Deliverable**: Feature-complete module with both visual modes, UI controls, and configurable settings.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 Permission & Visibility System
- [ ] Implement player permission handling (own tokens only)
- [ ] Add GM visibility for all tokens including hidden
- [ ] Create proper hidden token handling
- [ ] Test permission edge cases

### 3.2 Combat Integration
- [ ] Implement auto-combat activation feature
- [ ] Add combat state detection
- [ ] Create configurable auto-toggle settings
- [ ] Handle combat start/end events properly

### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement 200-token limit with configurable maximum
- [ ] Optimize distance calculation algorithms
- [ ] Add efficient rendering pipeline
- [ ] Create performance monitoring and warnings

### 3.4 Real-time Updates
- [ ] Implement smooth real-time category updates
- [ ] Add planned movement preview functionality
- [ ] Optimize update frequency and performance
- [ ] Handle rapid token movement scenarios

**Deliverable**: Production-ready module with advanced features and optimized performance.

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Week 7)

### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Test with various FoundryVTT versions
- [ ] Validate across different game systems
- [ ] Performance testing with maximum token counts
- [ ] Edge case testing (scene changes, invalid tokens, etc.)

### 4.2 Documentation & User Experience
- [ ] Create user documentation and setup instructions
- [ ] Add accessibility features for colorblind users
- [ ] Implement proper error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Create demonstration materials

### 4.3 Code Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Code review and refactoring
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Prepare for module distribution

**Deliverable**: Fully tested, documented, and distribution-ready module.

## Phase 5: Release & Future Enhancements (Week 8+)

### 5.1 Module Release
- [ ] Package module for FoundryVTT module browser
- [ ] Create release documentation
- [ ] Submit to community repositories
- [ ] Set up user support channels

### 5.2 Future Enhancement Considerations
- [ ] Grid-based movement support
- [ ] Additional distance measurement methods
- [ ] Custom color schemes and themes
- [ ] Integration with movement/speed systems
- [ ] Multi-language localization
- [ ] Advanced token relationship features

## Key Milestones

- **Week 2**: MVP with basic ring display working
- **Week 4**: Full feature set implemented and functional
- **Week 6**: Performance optimized and combat-ready
- **Week 7**: Tested and documented
- **Week 8**: Released to community

## Risk Mitigation

- **FoundryVTT API Changes**: Keep module compatible with stable API versions
- **Performance Issues**: Implement configurable limits and optimization early
- **User Experience**: Regular testing with actual gameplay scenarios
- **System Compatibility**: Test with multiple game systems throughout development

## Success Criteria

- Module works smoothly with 200+ tokens
- Real-time updates without lag
- Intuitive user interface
- System-agnostic compatibility
- Positive community feedback
- Clean, maintainable codebase
